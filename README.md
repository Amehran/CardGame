# SampleCardGame
it is a sample of the CARS memory card game.
ultimately in the complete app, the user can pick 2 cards and see if they are matched. in the meantime he/she can learn about the features and other information about the can in the second page.

there is going to be another class to keep score and another one to register users and sync with the back-end infrastructure.
